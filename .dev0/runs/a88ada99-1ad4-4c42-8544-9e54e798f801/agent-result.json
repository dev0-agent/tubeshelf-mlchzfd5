  "prBody": "Implemented the tagging system UI and logic as requested.

Changes:
- Created `src/components/tag-manager.tsx`: A new component for managing tags (create, toggle) using a Popover and Command interface.
- Updated `src/context/video-context.tsx`: Modified `addTag` to return the created tag synchronously, enabling immediate selection of new tags.
- Updated `src/pages/Player.tsx`: Integrated `TagManager` into the video player view to allow users to manage tags while watching.",
  "notes": "The tagging UI is accessible via a 'Manage Tags' button next to the tags list in the player view."
