  "prTitle": "Video Grid Component Implementation",
  "prBody": "This PR implements the Video Grid component for the TubeShelf dashboard. 

Key changes:
- Created `VideoCard` component in `src/components/video-card.tsx` to display video metadata (thumbnail, title, tags).
- Added inline title editing capability directly on the video card.
- Implemented navigation to the Player view upon clicking a card.
- Updated `Library` page to fetch videos from the global context and render them in a responsive grid.
- Added a simple empty state for the library.
- Verified type safety with `tsc`.",
  "notes": "The video cards are responsive and use shadcn/ui components for consistent styling. Navigation to the player uses a query parameter `?v=videoId` which will be handled by the Player integration task."
